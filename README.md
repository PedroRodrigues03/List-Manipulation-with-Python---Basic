# List Manipulation with Python - Basic


## Developers

* Pedro Lopes Rodrigues


# How will it works?

We'll work using a list of products that have name, price and category as attributes given from a random user (who wants to run this small and basic code).
The user will be able to choose when he wants to stop adding new products and then he'll be free to choose if he wants to order by name, price, category or exit the program.
This is a basic project, where i won't be worried about exceptions (maybe in the future) or DB, for now at least.
This program has been writed to show how List Comprehension, Lambda Function e Deep Copy can be usefull for begginers.
